### Version 1.1  (*Jan 22, 2017*)

* Re-pivoted the book around TypeScript and the `async/await` syntax. Moved the JS-specific content to a separate Appendix
* Added an information-packed JavaScript & TypeScript crash-course, tailored specifically at Office.js concepts, for those who are new to the world of JS/TS.
* With TypeScript now a first-class citizen of the book, added "*Getting started with building TypeScript-based Add-ins*" (section 3.2).  I expect to continue to expand this section in future releases.

* Re-arranged, edited, and added to the content of the "*Office.js APIs: Core concepts*" chapter (chapter 5).

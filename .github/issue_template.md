### Some instructions

**#1:** Before submitting an issue, please ensure that you have the latest version of the book.

> *You can compare the "This version was published on [date]" of your copy of the book (2nd page in the PDF), versus the "Last updated on [date]" at <https://leanpub.com/buildingofficeaddins/> (right beneath the cover image)*

**#2**:  Please describe the issue, including *where in the book you've seen the issue*.  Page numbers and section numbers change all the time, so a screenshot or a description of the text before/after is best.  *(Tip: if you use the Snipping tool in Windows, you can capture just the portion of the screen that you'd like, and and then simply paste using Ctrl+V into GitHub -- no need to save the file or do any intermediary steps).* 

**#3**: Preface your issue title with one of the following:

* **[Content issue]:** A misspelling, an incomplete phrase, a sentence that no longer makes sense, etc.
* **[Needs more details]:** Requests for additional detail in *existing* topics.
* **[Topic request]:** Requests for a *brand new topic*.
* **[Sample code]:** Issues with sample code or related assets.

Thus, a title of an issue might be "***[Topic request]** Add info on different Office namespaces:  Office, OfficeExtension, Excel, Word, etc.*"

**#4**: Feel free to remove these instructions when you're done.
